                    <p>Hello! My name is Jason Rivers, and I currently live and work in one of the most magical places I’ve ever known—Lijiang, China. As the operations manager of a boutique hotel here, my life is a blend of professional hospitality, daily cultural encounters, and an endless stream of inspiration from the breathtaking landscapes around me. I’m originally from Vancouver, Canada, but I can honestly say Lijiang has become a second home in every sense.</p><p><br></p><p>Lijiang is not just a city—it’s an experience. The moment you step into its Old Town, with winding cobblestone alleys, canals lined with willow trees, and traditional Naxi architecture, you feel like time slows down. Working in hotel management allows me to see this magic through the eyes of visitors from all over the world. Each guest brings a different story, a different curiosity, and I get to be both a host and a fellow explorer.</p><p><br></p><p>When I’m not managing check-ins, arranging tours, or ensuring our guests’ stays are flawless, I’m out exploring myself. Living in Lijiang means being surrounded by destinations that are as varied as they are stunning. Jade Dragon Snow Mountain is practically in my backyard—its glaciers shimmering under the sun, its hiking trails offering both challenge and serenity. I’ve been there countless times, yet every visit feels fresh, like the mountain is revealing a new side of itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there’s Baisha Village, a place I never get tired of. Unlike the busier parts of Lijiang, Baisha has a quiet, lived-in authenticity. I love cycling there early in the morning, stopping to have a bowl of rice noodles while watching the first light spill over the rooftops. The local murals, centuries old, still carry a sense of mystery that fuels my imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>My travel style is not about rushing from one sight to another; it’s about immersing myself in the rhythm of a place. That’s why weekends often find me wandering through Shuhe Ancient Town, sitting in a courtyard café, or hiking into remote valleys where time seems to have stood still. I’m fascinated by the Naxi culture—its music, its Dongba script, and the way it has preserved traditions while embracing modernity. Many of my favorite moments have come from sharing tea with locals who tell stories of their ancestors, of trade caravans, and of festivals that go back generations.</p><p><br></p><p>What I find especially unique about Lijiang as a base for travel is its incredible diversity of landscapes within just a few hours’ reach. One weekend I might be rafting on the Jinsha River, the next I could be hiking Tiger Leaping Gorge, feeling the raw power of the Yangtze as it forces its way between towering cliffs. There are also quieter retreats—like Lashihai Lake, where the water mirrors the sky and migratory birds rest during their long journeys. Sitting there, watching the reflections ripple, I often find my best ideas for work and for life.</p><p><br></p><p>In hotel management, attention to detail is everything—anticipating a guest’s needs, creating a space that feels welcoming yet distinctive. I think my travel experiences feed directly into my work. Every time I visit a new place, I pay close attention to what makes me feel at ease as a traveler, and I bring those lessons back to our hotel. Whether it’s offering a warm towel after a winter hike, or suggesting a hidden teahouse to a guest, I want their stay to feel like more than a trip—I want it to feel like a connection.</p><p><br></p><p>Food, too, plays a big part in how I experience travel. Lijiang has an incredible mix of Naxi, Tibetan, and Yunnan cuisine, and I love trying local specialties in tiny family-run restaurants tucked away from the main streets. Yunnan ham, yak butter tea, wild mushroom hotpots—these are more than just meals; they’re cultural stories you can taste. Whenever I travel to nearby areas like Shangri-La or Dali, I make it a point to try something new and bring back ideas for our hotel’s menu.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the past few years, I’ve also grown more interested in sustainable tourism. Lijiang is a popular destination, and I’ve seen firsthand how important it is to balance preservation with hospitality. I’ve started partnering with local guides who lead eco-friendly treks, and I encourage guests to explore respectfully—learning a few phrases in the local language, supporting small businesses, and leaving the landscapes as they found them.</p><p><br></p><p>For me, travel is not about escape—it’s about deepening my sense of place. I’ve learned that you don’t have to go far to discover something extraordinary; sometimes it’s in the alley you’ve walked past a hundred times, or in a conversation over tea with someone you just met. Living in Lijiang gives me the chance to explore not only the world around me, but also my own values—patience, curiosity, and genuine connection.</p><p><br></p><p>So, if you ever find yourself in Lijiang and you see someone cycling along a mountain road with a camera slung over his shoulder and a big grin on his face, it might just be me—Jason Rivers—ready for another day of both hosting travelers and being one myself.</p>                </div>
